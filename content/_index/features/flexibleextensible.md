GSLP enables a clear separation between a diagram client and a GSLP server, which communicate using the define protocol. This flexible approach provides a clear encapsulation of your domain-specific diagram logic on the server from the rendering part on the client. The diagram client is highly customizable and extensible to add custom shapes or editing features.
