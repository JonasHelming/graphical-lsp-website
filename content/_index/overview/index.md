GSLP is an extensible open source framework to built custom diagram editor in the web/cloud. Those editors can be deployed stand-alone or integrated into a web-based IDE such as Eclipse Theia or VS Code. GSLP works like the language server protocol (LSP) for diagrams and integrates well with you existing tool chain and business logic.
