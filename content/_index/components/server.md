Enabled by the flexible protocol-based architecture, a domain-specific GLSP server can be implemented in any preferred technology. Therefore, you can easily integrate a GLSP server into an existing environment and reuse the domain-specific business and diagram logic. GLSP provides a frame for the implementation of GLSP servers using Java, as well as integrations with EMF and other existing modeling technologies.
