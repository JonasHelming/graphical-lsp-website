The purpose of [the GLSP minimal diagram example](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-examples), as the name implies, is to provide a minimal feature set and therefore be very easy to understand. The example supports exactly one node rendered as a rectangle. However, it still demonstrates a lot of powerful GLSP features such as undo/redo, resizing, zooming, etc. The minimal example is embedded into [Eclipse Theia](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia/).
